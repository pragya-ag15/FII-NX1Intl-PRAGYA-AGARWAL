Food Waste Prediction AI Tool for Restaurants

UN SDG Target: Zero Hunger – Reducing food waste by restaurants

Project Description

This AI tool predicts the amount of food waste that will be generated by restaurants based on event-specific details such as the number of attendees, event type, target audience, cost, seasonality, and menu type. By providing accurate predictions, restaurant owners can adjust the amount of food prepared, prevent unnecessary waste, and even donate surplus food to reduce overall food loss, addressing UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger.

Features / Functionality

1. Predicts food waste (in grams) for a restaurant event based on input details.
2. Uses historical event data to generate predictions.
3. Provides actionable insights for restaurant owners to reduce food waste.
4. Interactive widget interface in the notebook for easy experimentation.



Dataset

The dataset used for training the model contains details such as:
1. Event type (wedding, corporate event, party, etc.)
2. Number of attendees
3. Target audience
4. Seasonal details
5. Menu composition (meat, fruits, vegetables, etc.)
6. Historical food waste (grams)

The dataset is included in the repository for testing.

Installation / Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/pragya-ag15/FII-NX1Intl-PRAGYA-AGARWAL.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook in Colab or Jupyter and run the cells in order.

How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run all the cells to load the model and data.
3. Use the interactive widget interface to input event details:
 a.Event type
 b. Number of people
 c. Target audience
 d. Menu type
 e. Cost per person, etc.
The tool outputs the predicted food waste (in grams) for the event.
